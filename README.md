# Playlist Manager

This project is a C++ implementation of a dynamic playlist manager, designed to explore fundamental linked data structures and modular programming. The playlist supports inserting new songs, removing songs, and traversing through the list while maintaining order. Commands are provided via structured input files, enabling reproducible test cases and automated testing.

A focus of this project was robust handling of edge cases â€” such as attempts to delete nonexistent songs or navigating an empty playlist. The design leverages object-oriented programming, separating the playlist logic from the driver interface, which improves maintainability and scalability. By modeling playlist operations as generalized data structure operations, this project demonstrates how abstract data types can be applied to real-world problems like media organization.
